# MEST
MEST stands for the Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology. It provides training, investment and mentoring for aspiring Ghanaian software entrepreneurs with the goal of creating globally successful companies that create wealth and jobs locally in Africa. It is located in Accra, Ghana.

# What has MEST got to do with me?
I am a technical teaching fellow for the Class of 2014 and 2015. I teach the EITs (Entrepreneurs in Training) how to code. Spending a year in Ghana, doing what I love!

# Why am I creating these notes?
I have always used notes to remember important things from the classes I take and the videos I watch. Sharing them here in case someone else finds them useful. I would really appreciate and entertain pull requests that correct spelling mistakes, or enhance the content.

#### EITs get extra points for sending in a pull request! :)
